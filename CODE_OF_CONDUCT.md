# Code of Conduct

## Quick Version

Consumer Reports is dedicated to providing a safe and harassment-free work experience 
for everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability status, mental health, neurotype, age, physical appearance, body
type, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, or class. We do not
tolerate harassment or discrimination in any form and we are committed to
partnering with you to foster a healthy working environment.

## Full Version

We prioritize the safety and wellbeing of marginalized people who are
underrepresented in the communities that we serve, or are oppressed by
structural sexism, racism, classism, ableism, homophobia, xenophobia, and
transphobia. This includes but is not limited to: women, people of color,
people with disabilities, people with prior military service, formerly
incarcerated people, people who identify as LGBTQIA+, indigenous peoples, first
and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.

By contributing to the development of this tool you agree to abide by this
code of conduct and cooperate with the Consumer Reports staff who enforce it.

### Expected Behavior

Individuals are expected to behave appropriately and professionally during
their participation in this project. In particular, all individuals 
should actively avoid intentionally or unintentionally participating in the 
harassment of individuals. Harassment includes offensive comments related to 
gender, sexual orientation, disability, mental health, neurotype, age, 
physical appearance, body, race, ethnicity, nationality or religion; 
deliberate or repeated misgendering; sexual images in public spaces;
intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording;
sustained disruption in meetings, lectures or other spaces; physical contact
and simulated physical contact (e.g. emoji or textual descriptions) without
consent; and unwelcome sexual attention. Consent must be freely given,
enthusiastic, informed, specific, and reversible affirmation of a request.

Individuals are expected to demonstrate kindness and care when communicating
with one another. In recognizing the importance of diverse perspectives and
expertise, Bocoup expects individuals to listen actively, and to interact with
respect and humility.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Consumer Reports in the course of enforcing this Code of Conduct may, at its own
discretion, ask an individual to stop some behavior, warn the individual of
their violation, or further sanction the individual. 

### Reporting Unacceptable Behavior

If you would like to report a violation of this Code of
Conduct, please contact Ginny Fahs at ginny.fahs.consultant@consumer.org. Any further 
communication will be determined with your consent. If
another individual asks you to stop engaging in some behavior in the course of
your work with Consumer Reports, you should comply immediately, and are encouraged to
contact Ginny Fahs for further guidance.

Consumer Reports prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over the comfort of individuals
in positions of privilege. Consumer Reports reserves the right not to act on complaints
regarding “reverse-isms”, reasonable communication of boundaries, complaints
about tone premised on stereotypes, or criticism of racist, sexist, classist or
otherwise oppressive behavior.
