Hello,

To confirm your phone number, you will receive a code via SMS that you can enter in your web browser.

Once your email and phone are confirmed, you will move onto the final step: signing a Power of Attorney on DocuSign that gives Consumer Reports permission to act as your authorized agent.

Thank you for doing your part to ensure stronger data rights in California! We're thrilled to have you as part of our pilot.

Best,
Ginny and the CR Digital Lab team
